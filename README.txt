Pokemon Ranger

For another homework assignment for my Unity class, we had the task to design and develop a 3D campus scene using what we had recently learned.

The requirements for the assignment are as follows:

- design and create a 3D campus environment. The elements for the campus include buildings, trees, landscape, grasses, playground, etc
- create dynamic water (lake/pond/river) by yourself, a screenshot of all wired nodes in the water shader is needed 
- add directional light
- add point light
- add spotlight
- add two or more area lights
- add the first-person character from the Standard Assets
- modify the C# code to make the first-person game runnable
- use two cameras: one for the player (this one is already included in the first-person character) and another one showing the map location of the player in real time
- Add water sound to the dynamic water object. Play the sound every time the player approaches the water
- Add background music to your game

For this project, since a specific campus was not assigned, I decided to make my own redition of the school campus in the 2008 Nintendo DS game Pokemon Ranger: Shadows of Almia.
I included the main school building, the training hall, obstacles in the field students train on, and the monument Pledge Stone by the docks.
